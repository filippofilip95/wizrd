> **This is an example** showing how to track project status. Update after every work session.

## Current Phase
Implementation (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress)

## Just Completed (Last 3 Days)
- Finished quote generator MVP
- Deployed to staging environment
- Got positive feedback from Sarah on demo

## Working On Right Now
- Inventory alert system design - waiting for Marcus's API docs
- Dashboard wireframes - 70% complete
- Training documentation - started

## Blocked / Waiting
- ERP API documentation
  - **Requested from**: Marcus Weber (IT Lead)
  - **Requested on**: 2026-01-14
  - **Expected by**: 2026-01-18
  - **Impact if delayed**: Can't start inventory integration

## Recent Client Feedback
- "The quote generator is faster than I expected!" - Sarah, 2026-01-15
- "Security review will take 5 days" - Marcus, 2026-01-14

## Next 3 Work Sessions
1. Complete dashboard wireframes
2. Review Marcus's API docs when received
3. Start inventory alert backend

## Open Questions
- Should alerts go to Slack or email?
- What's the threshold for "low inventory"?

## Team Notes
Sarah prefers demos over documentation. Schedule weekly 15-min demos.
