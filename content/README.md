## Content Generation Workflow

### Using the Content Agent

```bash
# Generate LinkedIn posts
"Use the content agent to create LinkedIn posts from [source]"

# Create a case study
"Use the content agent to draft a case study from [client] project"

# Generate blog article
"Use the content agent to outline a blog post about [topic]"
```

### Content Pillars (Example)

If you want structured content:

- **Monday**: Cut the hype - debunk oversold tools/promises
- **Wednesday**: Quick wins - tactical playbooks with real results
- **Friday**: Builder's cut - honest failures and lessons

## File Naming

```
# LinkedIn posts
YYYY-MM-DD-[pillar]-[topic].md

# Blog articles
YYYY-MM-[slug].md

# Case studies
[industry]-[year]-[brief-description].md
```
