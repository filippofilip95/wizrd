## Content Generation Workflow

### Using the Content Agent

```bash
# Generate LinkedIn posts from a project
"Use the content agent to create LinkedIn posts from the [client] lessons learned"

# Create a case study
"Use the content agent to draft a case study from [client] project"

# Repurpose content
"Use the content agent to turn this case study into 3 LinkedIn posts"
```

### Content Pillars (Customize These)

Structure your content around themes:

- **Monday**: [PILLAR 1] - e.g., Cut the hype, debunk oversold tools
- **Wednesday**: [PILLAR 2] - e.g., Quick wins, tactical playbooks
- **Friday**: [PILLAR 3] - e.g., Builder's cut, honest failures

## File Naming

```
# LinkedIn posts
YYYY-MM-DD-[pillar]-[topic].md
Example: 2026-01-15-cut-the-hype-ai-timelines.md

# Case studies
[industry]-[year]-[brief-description].md
Example: logistics-2026-inventory-automation.md

# Blog articles
YYYY-MM-[slug].md

```
